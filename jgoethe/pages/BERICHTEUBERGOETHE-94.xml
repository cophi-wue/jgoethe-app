This was the Frau Räthin Goethe. She had the mien and deportment of a strong person. . . She had a bold tone of conversation, spoke of her son with pride and satisfaction. . . <anchor xml:id="SHESPOKEALSO" TEIform="anchor"/>She spoke also of the origin of <title type="Goethewerk" TEIform="title">Götz von Berlichingen</title>. He came home one evening in high spirits. "Oh, mother," he said, "I have found such a book in the public library, and I will make a play of it!
