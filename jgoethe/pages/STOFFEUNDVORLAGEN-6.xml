What dost thou behold in the plain? The stormy winds are laid. The murmur of the torrent comes from afar. Roaring waves 
climb the distant rock. The flies of evening are on their feeble wings, and the hum of their course is on the field. What dost thou behold, fair light? But thou dost smile and depart. The waves come with joy around thee, and bathe thy lovely hair. Farewel, thou silent beam! - Let the light of 
Ossian's soul arise.</p><p xml:id="JG24876" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">And it does arise in its strength! I behold my departed friends. Their gathering is on Lora, as in the days that are past. - Fingal comes like a watry column of mist; his heroes are around. And see the bards of the song, gray-haired Ullin; stately Ryno; Alpin, 
with the tuneful voice, and the soft complaint of Minona! - How are ye changed, my friends, since the days of Selma's feast! when we contended, like the gales of the spring, that, flying over the hill, by turns bend the feebly-whistling grass.</p><p xml:id="JG24877" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Minona came forth in her beauty; with down cast look and tearful eye; her hair flew slowly on the blast that rushed unfrequent from the hill. - The souls of the heroes were sad when she raised the tuneful voice; for often had they seen the graves of Salgar, and 
the dark dwelling of white-bosomed Colma. Colma left alone on the hill, with all her voice of music! Salgar promised to come: but the night descended round. - Hear the voice of Colma, when she sat alone on the hill!</p><div5 xml:id="JG24878" type="Überschrift5" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div5"><head TEIform="head">Colma.</head><p xml:id="JG24879" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">It is night; - I am alone, forlorn on the hill of storms. The wind is heard in the mountain. The torrent shrieks down the rock. No hut receives me from the rain; forlorn on the hill of winds.</p><p xml:id="JG24880" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Rise, moon! from behind thy clouds; stars of the night appear! Lead me, some light, to the place where my love rests from the toil of the chace! his bow near him, unstrung; his dogs panting around him. But here I must sit alone, by the rock of mossy stream. The 
stream and the wind roar; nor can I hear the voice of my love.</p><p xml:id="JG24881" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Why delays my Salgar, why the son of the hill, his promise? Here is the rock, and the tree; and here the roaring stream. Thou didst promise with night to be here. Ah! whither is my Salgar gone? With thee I would fly, my father; with thee, my brother of pride. 
Our race have long been foes; but we are not foes, O Salgar!</p><p xml:id="JG24882" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Cease a little while, O wind! stream, be thou silent a while! let my voice be heard over the heath; let my wanderer hear me. Salgar! it is I who call. Here is the tree, and the rock. Salgar, my love! I am here. Why delayest thou thy coming?</p><p xml:id="JG24883" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Lo! the moon appeareth. The flood is bright in a vale. The rocks are grey on the face of the hill. But I see him not on the brow; his dogs before him tell not that he is coming. Here I must sit alone.</p><p xml:id="JG24884" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But who are these that lie beyond me on the heath? Are they my love and my brother? - Speak to me, O my friends! they answer not. My soul is tormented with fears. - Ah! they are dead. Their swords are red from the fight. O my brother! my brother! why hast thou 
slain my Salgar? why, O Salgar! hast thou slain my brother? Dear were ye both to me! what shall I say in your praise? Thou wert fair on the hill among thousands; he was terrible in fight. Speak to me; hear my voice, sons of my love! But alas! they are silent; silent for ever! Cold are their 
breasts of clay!</p><p xml:id="JG24885" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Oh! from the rock of the hill; from the top of the windy mountain, speak ye ghosts of the dead! speak, I will not be afraid. - Whither are ye gone to rest? In what cave of the hill shall I find you? No feeble voice is on the wind: no answer half-drowned in the 
storms of the hill.</p><p xml:id="JG24886" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">I sit in my grief. I wait for morning in my tears. Rear the tomb, ye friends of the dead; but close it not till Colma come. My life flies away like a dream: why should I stay behind? Here shall I rest with my friends, by the stream of the sounding rock. When 
night comes on the hill; when the wind is on the heath; my ghost shall stand in the wind, and mourn the death of my friends. The hunter shall hear from his booth. He shall fear but love my voice. For sweet shall my voice be for my friends; for pleasant were they both to me.</p><p xml:id="JG24887" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Such was thy song, Minona softly-blushing maid of Torman. Our tears descended for Colma, and our souls were sad. - Ullin came with the harp, and gave the song of Alpin. - The voice of Alpin was pleasant: the soul of Ryno was a beam of fire. But they had rested 
in the narrow house: and their voice was not heard in Selma. - Ullin had returned one day from the chace, before the heroes fell. He heard their strife on the hill; their song was soft but sad. They mourned the fall of Morar, first of mortal men.. His soul was like the soul of Fingal; his sword 
like the sword of Oscar. - But he fell, and his father mourned: his sister's eyes were full of tears. - Minona's eyes were full of tears, the sister of car-borne Morar. She retired from the song of Ullin, like the moon in the west, when she foresees the shower, and hides her fair head in a 
cloud. - I touched the harp, with Ullin; the song of mourning rose.</p></div5><div5 xml:id="JG24888" type="Überschrift5" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div5"><head TEIform="head">Ryno.</head><p xml:id="JG24889" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The wind and the rain are over: calm is the noon of day. The clouds are divided in heaven. Over the green hills flies the inconstant sun. Red through the stony vale comes down the stream of the hill. Sweet are thy murmurs, O stream! but more sweet is the voice I 
hear. It is the voice of Alpin, the son of the song, mourning for the dead. Bent is his head of age, and red his tearful eye. Alpin, thou son of the song, why alone on the silent hill? why complainest thou, as a blast in the wood; as a wave on the lonely shore?</p></div5><div5 xml:id="JG24890" type="Überschrift5" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div5"><head TEIform="head">Alpin.</head><p xml:id="JG24891" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">My tears, O Ryno! are for the dead; my voice, for the inhabitants of the grave. Tall thou art on the hill; fair among the sons of the plain. But thou shalt fall like Morar; and the mourner shall sit on thy tomb. The hills shall know thee no more; thy bow shall 
lie in the hall, unstrung.</p><p xml:id="JG24892" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Thou wert swift, O Morar! as a roe on the hill; terrible as a meteor of fire. Thy wrath was as the storm. Thy sword in battle, as lightning in the field. Thy voice was like a stream after rain; like thunder on distant hills. Many fell by thy arm; they were 
consumed in the flames of thy wrath.</p><p xml:id="JG24893" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But when thou didst return from war, how peaceful was thy brow! Thy face was like the sun after rain; like the moon in the silence of night; calm as the breast of the lake when the loud wind is laid.</p><p xml:id="JG24894" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Narrow is thy dwelling now; dark the place of thine abode. With three steps I compass thy grave, O thou who wast so great before! Four stones, with their heads of moss, are the only memorial of thee. A tree with scarce a leaf, long grass which whistles in the 
wind, mark to the hunter's eye the grave of the mighty Morar. Morar! thou art low indeed. Thou hast no mother to mourn thee; no maid with her tears of love. Dead is she that brought thee forth. Fallen is the daughter of Morglan.</p><p xml:id="JG24895" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Who on his staff is this? who is this, whose head is white with age, whose eyes are red with tears, who quakes at every step. - It is thy father, O Morar! the father of no son but thee. He heard of thy fame in battle; he heard of foes dispersed. He heard of 
Morar's fame; why did he not hear of his wound? Weep, thou father of Morar! weep; but thy son heareth thee not. Deep is the sleep of the dead; low their pillow of dust. No more shall he hear thy voice; no more shall he awake at thy call. When shall it be morn in the grave, to bid the slumberer 
awake?</p><p xml:id="JG24896" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Farewel, thou bravest of men! thou conqueror in the field! but the field shall see thee no more; nor the dark wood be lightened with the splendor of thy steel. Thou hast left no son. But the song shall preserve thy name. Future times shall hear of thee; they 
shall hear of the fallen Morar.</p><p xml:id="JG24897" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The grief of all arose, but most the bursting sigh of Armin[.] He remembers the death of his son, who fell in the days of his youth. Carmor was near the hero, the chief of the ecchoing Galmal. Why bursts the sigh of Armin, he said? Is there a cause to mourn? The 
song comes, with its music, to melt and please the soul. It is like soft mist, that, rising from a lake, pours on the silent vale; the green flowers are filled with dew, but the sun returns in his strength, and the mist is gone. Why art thou sad, O Armin, chief of sea-surrounded Gorma?</p><p xml:id="JG24898" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Sad! I am indeed: nor small my cause of woe! - Carmor, thou hast lost no son; thou hast lost no daughter of beauty. Colgar the valiant lives; and Annira fairest maid. The boughs of thy family flourish, O Carmor! but Armin is the last of his race. Dark is thy 
bed, O Daura! and deep thy sleep in the tomb. - When shalt thou awake with thy songs? with all thy voice of music?</p><p xml:id="JG24899" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Rise, winds of autumn, rise; blow upon the dark heath! streams of the mountains, roar! howl, ye tempests, in the top of the oak! walk through broken clouds, O moon! show by intervals thy pale face! bring to my mind that sad night, when all my children fell; when 
Arindal the mighty fell; when Dura the lovely failed.</p><p xml:id="JG24900" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Daura, my daughter! thou wert fair; fair as the moon on the hills of Fura; white as the driven snow; sweet as the breathing gale. Arindal, thy bow was strong, thy spear was swift in the field: thy look was like mist on the wave; thy shield, a red cloud in a 
storm. Armar, renowned in war, came, and sought Daura's love; he was not long denied; fair was the hope of their friends.</p><p xml:id="JG24901" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Erath, son of Odgal, repined; for his brother was slain by Armar. He came disguised like a son of the sea: fair was his skiff on the wave; white his locks of age; calm his serious brow. Fairest of women, he said, lovely daughter of Armin! a rock not distant in 
the sea, bears a tree on its side; red shines the fruit afar. There Armor waits for Daura. I came to carry his love along the rolling sea.</p><p xml:id="JG24902" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">She went; and she called on Armar. Nought answered, but the son of the rock. Armor, my love! my love! why tormentest thou me with fear? hear, son of Ardnart, hear: it is Daura who calleth thee! Erath the traitor fled laughing to the land. She lifted up her 
voice, and cried for her brother and her father. Arindal! Armin! none to relieve your Daura.</p><p xml:id="JG24903" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Her voice came over the sea. Arindal my son descended from the hill; rough in the spoils of the chace. His arrows rattled by his side; his bow was in his hand: five dark gray dogs attended his steps. He saw fierce Erath on the shore: he seized and bound him to 
an oak. Thick fly the thongs of the hide around his limbs; he loads the wind with his groans.</p><p xml:id="JG24904" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Arindal ascends the deep in his boat, to bring Daura to land. Armar came in his wrath, and let fly the gray-feathered shaft. It sung; it sunk in thy heart, O Arindal my son! for Erath the traitor thou diedst. The oar is stopped at once; he panted on the rock and 
expired. What is thy grief, O Daura, when round thy feet is poured thy brother's blood.</p><p xml:id="JG24905" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The boat is broken in twain by waves. Armar plunges into the sea, to rescue his Daura or die. Sudden a blast from the hill comes over the waves. He sunk, and he rose no more.</p><p xml:id="JG24906" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Alone, on the sea-beat rock, my daughter was heard to complain. Frequent and loud were her cries; nor could her father relieve her. All night I stood on the shore. I saw her by the faint beam of the moon. night I heard her cries. Loud was the wind; and the rain 
beat hard on the side of the mountain. Before morning appeared, her voice was weak. It died away, like the evening-breeze among the grass of the rocks. Spent with grief she expired. And left the Allmin alone: gone is my strength in the war, and fallen my pride among women.</p><p xml:id="JG24907" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">When the storms of the mountain come; when the north lifts the waves on high; I sit by the sounding shore, and lock on the fatal rock. Often by the setting moon I see the ghosts of my children. Half-viewless, they walk in mournful conference together. Will none 
of you speak in pity? They do not regard their father. I am sad, O Carmor, nor small my cause of woe!</p><p xml:id="JG24908" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Such were the words of the bards in the days of the song; when the king heard the music of harps, and the tales of other times. The chiefs gathered from all their hills, and heard the lovely sound. They praised the voice of Cona! the first among a thousand 
bards. But age is now on my tongue; and my soul has failed. I hear, sometimes, the ghosts of bards, and learn their pleasant song. But memory fails on my mind; I hear the call of years. They say, as they pass along, why does Ossian sing? Soon shall he lie in the narrow house, and no bard shall 
raise his fame.</p><p xml:id="JG24909" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Roll on, ye dark-browm years, for ye bring no joy on your course. Let the tomb open to Ossian, for his strength has failed. The sons of the song are gone to rest; my voice remains, like a blast, that roars, lonely, on a sea-surrounded rock, after the winds are 
laid. The dark moss whistles there, and the distant mariner sees the waving trees.</p><p xml:id="JG24910" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">[...]<lb TEIform="lb"/></p></div5></div4><div4 xml:id="JG24911" type="Überschrift4" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N" TEIform="div4"><head TEIform="head">Berrathon:</head><p xml:id="JG24912" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">A Poem.</p><p xml:id="JG24913" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Bend thy blue course, O stream, round the narrow plain of Lutha. Let the green woods hang over it from their mountains: and the sun look on it at noon. The thistle is there on its rock, and shakes its beard to the wind. The flower hangs its heavy head, waving, 
at times, to the gale. Why dost thou awake me, O gale, it seems to say, I am covered with the drops of heaven? The time of my fading is near, and the blast that shall scatter my leaves. Tomorrow shall the traveller come, he that saw me in my beauty shall come; his eyes will search the field, 
but they will not find me? - So shall they search in vain, for the voice of Cona, after it has failed in the field. The hunter shall come forth in the morning, and the voice of my harp shall not be heard. "Where is the son of carborne Fingal?" The tear will be on his cheek.</p><p xml:id="JG24914" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Then come thou, O Malvina, with all thy music, come; lay Ossian in the plain of Lutha: let his tomb rise in the lovely field. - Malvina! where art thou, with thy songs: with the soft sound of thy steps? - Son of Alpin art thou near? where is the daughter of 
Toscar?</p><p xml:id="JG24915" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">I passed, O son of Fingal, by Tar-lutha's mossy walls. The smoke of the hall was ceased: silence was among the trees of the hill. The voice of the chace was over. I saw the daughters of the bow. I asked about Malvina, but they answered not. They turned their 
faces away: thin darkness covered their beauty. They were like stars, on a rainy hill, by night, each looking faintly through her mist.</p><p xml:id="JG24916" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Pleasant be thy rest, O lovely beam! soon hast thou set on our hills! The steps of thy departure were stately, like the moon on the blue, trembling wave. But thou hast left us in darkness, first of the maids of Lutha! We sit, at the rock, and there is no voice; 
no light but the meteor of fire! Soon hast thou set, Malvina, daughter of generous Toscar!</p><p xml:id="JG24917" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But thou risest like the beam of the east, among the spirits of thy friends, where they sit in their stormy halls, the chambers of the thunder. - A cloud hovers over Cona: its blue curling sides are high. The winds are beneath it, with their wings; within it is 
the dwelling of Fingal. There the hero sits in darkness; his airy spear is in his hand. His shield half covered with clouds, is like the darkened moon; when one half still remains in the wave, and the other looks sickly on the field.</p><p xml:id="JG24918" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">His friends sit around the king, on mist; and hear the songs of Ullin: he strikes the half-viewless harp; and raises the feeble voice. The lesser heroes, with a thousand meteors, light the airy hall. Malvina rises, in the midst; a blush is on her cheek. She 
beholds the unknown faces of her fathers, and turns aside her humid eyes.</p><p xml:id="JG24919" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Art thou come so soon, said Fingal, daughter of generous Toscar? Sadness dwells in the halls of Lutha. My aged son is sad. I hear the breeze of Cona, that was wont to lift thy heavy locks. It comes to the hall, but thou art not there; its voice is mournful among 
the arms of thy fathers. Go with thy rustling wing, O breeze! and sigh on Malvina's tomb. It rises yonder beneath the rock, at the blue stream of Lutha. The maids are departed to their place; and thou alone, O breeze, mournest there.</p><p xml:id="JG24920" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But who comes from the dusky west, supported on a cloud? A smile is on his gray, watry face; his looks of mist fly on the wind: he bends forward on his airy spear: it is thy father, Malvina! Why shinest thou, so soon, on our clouds, he says, O lovely light of 
Lutha! - But thou wert sad, my daughter, for thy friends were passed away. The sons of little men were in the hall; and none remained of the heroes, but Ossian king of spears.</p><p xml:id="JG24921" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">And dost thou remember Ossian, car-borne Toscar son of Conloch? The battles of our youth were many; our swords went together to the field. They saw us coming like two falling rocks; and the sons of the stranger fled. There come the warriors of Cona, they said; 
their steps are in the paths of the vanquished.</p><p xml:id="JG24922" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Draw near, son of Alpin, to the song of the aged. The actions of other times are in my soul: my memory beams on the days that are past. On the days of the mighty Toscar, when our path was in the deep. Draw near, son of Alpin, to the last sound of the voice of 
Cona.</p><p xml:id="JG24923" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The king of Morven commanded, and I raised my sails to the wind. Toscar chief of Lutha stood at my side, as I rose on the dark-blue wave. Our course was to sea-surrounded Berrathon, the isle of many storms. There dwelt, with his locks of age, the stately 
strength of Larthmor. Larthmor who spread the feast of shells to Comhal's mighty son, when he went to Starno's halls, in the days of Agandecca. But when the chief was old, the pride of his son arose, the pride of fair-haired Uthal, the love of a thousand maids. He bound the aged Larthmor, and 
dwelt in his sounding halls.</p><p xml:id="JG24924" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Long pined the king in his cave, beside his rolling sea. Day did not come to his dwelling; nor the burning oak by night. But the wind of ocean was there, and the parting beam of the moon. The red star looked on the king, when it trembled on the western wave. 
Snitho came to Selma's hall: Snitho companion of Larthmor's youth. He told of the king of Berrathon: the wrath of Fingal rose. Thrice he assumed the spear, resolved to stretch his hand to Uthal. But the memory of his actions rose before the king, and he sent his son and Toscar. Our joy was 
great on the rolling sea; and were often half-unsheathed our swords. For never before had we fought alone, in the battles of the spear. Night came down on the ocean; the winds departed on their wings. Cold and pale is the moon. The red stars lift their heads. Our course is slow along the coast 
of Berrathon; the white waves tumble on the rocks.</p><p xml:id="JG24925" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">What voice is that, said Toscar, which comes between the sounds of the waves? It is soft but mournful, like the voice of departed bards. But I behold the maid, she sits on the rock alone. Her head bends on her arm of snow: her dark hair is in the wind. Hear, son 
of Fingal, her song, it is smooth as the gliding waters of Lavath. - We came to the silent bay, and heard the maid of night.</p><p xml:id="JG24926" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">How long will ye roll around me, blue-tumbling waters of ocean? My dwelling was not always in caves, nor beneath the whistling tree. The feast was spread in Torthóma's hall; my father delighted in my voice. The youths beheld me in the steps of my loveliness, and 
they blessed the dark-haired Nina-thoma. It was then thou didst come, O Uthal! like the sun of heaven. The souls of the virgins are thine, son of generous Larthmor! But why dost thou leave me alone in the midst of roaring waters. Was my soul dark with thy death? Did my white hand lift the 
sword? Why then hast thou left me alone, king of high Finthormo!</p><p xml:id="JG24927" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The tear started from my eye, when I heard the voice of the maid. I stood before her in my arms, and spoke the words of peace. - Lovely dweller of the cave, what sigh is in that breast? Shall Ossian lift his sword in thy presence, the destruction of thy foes? - 
Daughter of Thorthóma, rise, I have heard the words of thy grief. The race of Morven are around thee, who never injured the weak. Come to our dark-bosomed ship, thou brighter than that setting moon. Our course is to the rocky Berrathon, to the echoing walls of Finthormo. - She came in her 
beauty, she came with all her lovely steps. Silent joy brightened in her face, as when the shadows fly from the field of spring; the blue-stream is rolling in brightness, and the green bush bends over its course.</p><p xml:id="JG24928" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The morning rose with its beams. We came to Rothma's bay. A boar rushed from the wood; my spear pierced his side. I rejoiced over the blood, and foresaw my growing fame. - But now the sound of Uthal's train came from the high Fin-thormo; they spread over the 
heath to the chace of the boar. Himself comes slowly on, in the pride of his strength. He lifts two pointed spears. On his side is the hero's sword. Three youths carry his polished bows: the bounding of five dogs is before him. His heroes move on, at a distance, admiring the steps of the king. 
Stately was the son of Larthmor! but his soul was dark. Dark as the troubled face of the moon, when it foretels the storms.</p><p xml:id="JG24929" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">We rose on the heath before the king; he stopt in the midst of his course. His heroes gathered around, and a gray-haired bard advanced. Whence are the sons of the strangers! begun the bard of the song; the children of the unhappy come to Berrathon; to the sword 
of car-borne Uthal. He spreads no feast in his hall: the blood of strangers is on his streams. If from Selma's walls ye come, from the mossy walls of Fingal, chuse three youths to go to your king to tell of the fall of his people. Perhaps the hero may come and pour his blood on Uthal's sword; 
so shall the fame of Finthormo arise, like the growing tree of the vale.</p><p xml:id="JG24930" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Never will it rise, O bard, I said in the pride of my wrath. He would shrink in the presence of Fingal, whose eyes are the flames of death. The son of Comhal comes, and the kings vanish in his presence; they are rolled together, like mist, by the breath of his 
rage. Shall three tell to Fingal, that his people fell? Yes! - they may tell it, bard! but his people shall fall with fame.</p><p xml:id="JG24931" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">I stood in the darkness of my strength; Toscar drew his sword at my side. The foe came on like a stream: the mingled sound of death arose. Man took man, shield met shield; steel mixed its beams with steel. - Darts hiss through air; spears ring on mails; and 
swords on broken bucklers bound. As the noise of an aged grove beneath the roaring wind, when a thousand ghosts break the trees by night, such was the din of arms. - But Uthal fell beneath my sword; and the sons of Berrathon fled. - It was then I saw him in his beauty, and the tear hung in my 
eye. Thou art fallen, young tree, I said, with all thy beauty round thee. Thou art fallen on thy plains, and the field is bare. The winds come from the desart, and there is no sound in thy leaves! Lovely art thou in death, son of car-borne Larthmor.</p><p xml:id="JG24932" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Nina-thoma sat on the shore, and heard the sound of battle. She turned her red eyes on Lethmal the gray-haired bard of Selma, for he had remained on the coast, with the daughter of Torthóma. Son of the times of old! she said, I hear the noise of death. Thy 
friends have met with Uthal and the chief is low! O that I had remained on the rock, inclosed with the tumbling waves! Then would my soul be sad, but his death would not reach my ear. Art thou fallen on thy heath, O son of high Finthormo! thou didst leave me on a rock, but my soul was full of 
thee. Son of high Finthormo! art thou fallen on thy heath?</p><p xml:id="JG24933" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">She rose pale in her tears, and saw the bloody shield of Uthal; she saw it in Ossian's hand; her steps were distracted on the heath. She flew; she found him; she fell. Her soul came forth in a sigh. Her hair is spread on his face. My bursting tears descend. A 
tomb arose on the unhappy; and my song was heard.</p><p xml:id="JG24934" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Rest, hapless children of youth! and the noise of that mossy stream. The virgins will see your tomb, at the chace, and turn away their weeping eyes. Your fame will be in the song; the voice of the harp will be heard in your praise. The daughters of Selma shall 
hear it; and your renown shall be in other lands. - Rest, children of youth, at the noise of the mossy stream.</p><p xml:id="JG24935" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Two days we remained on the coast. The heroes of Berrathon convened. We brought Larthmor to his halls; the feast of shells is spread. - The joy of the aged was great; he looked to the arms of his fathers; the arms which he left in his hall, when the pride of 
Uthal arose - We were renowned before Larthmor, and he blessed the chiefs of Morven; but he knew not that his son was low, the stately strength of Uthal. They had told, that he had retired to the woods, with the tears of grief; they had told it, but he was silent in the tomb of Rothma's 
heath.</p><p xml:id="JG24936" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">On the fourth day we raised our sails to the roar of the northern wind. Larthmor came to the coast, and his bards raised the song. The joy of the king was great, he looked to Rothma's gloomy heath; he saw the tomb of his son; and the memory of Uthal rose. - Who 
of my heroes, he said, lies there: he seems to have been the kings of spears? Was he renowned in my halls, before the pride of Uthal rose?</p><p xml:id="JG24937" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Ye are silent, ye sons of Berrathon, is the king of heroes low? - My heart melts for thee, O Uthal; though thy hand was against thy father. - O that I had remained in the cave! that my son had dwelt in Finthormo! - I might have heard the tread of his feet, when 
he went to the chace of the boar. - I might have heard his voice on the blast of my cave. Then would my soul be glad: but now darkness dwells in my halls.</p><p xml:id="JG24938" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Such were my deeds, son of Alpin, when the arm of my youth was strong; such were the actions of Toscar, the car-borne son of Conloch. But Toscar is on his flying cloud; and I am alone at Lutha: my voice is like the last sound of the wind, when it foresakes the 
woods. But Ossian shall not be long alone, he sees the mist that shall receive his ghost. He beholds the mist that shall form his robe, when he appears on his hills. The sons of little men shall behold me, and admire the stature of the chiefs of old. They shall creep to their caves, and look to 
the sky with fear; for my steps shall be in the clouds, and darkness shall roll on my side.</p><p xml:id="JG24939" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Lead, son of Alpin, lead the aged to his woods. The winds begin to rise. The dark wave of the lake resounds. Bends there not a tree from Mora with its branches bare? It bends, son of Alpin, in the rustling blast. My harp hangs on a blasted branch. The sound of 
its strings is mournful. - Does the wind touch thee, O harp, or is it some passing ghost! - It is the hand of Malvina! but bring me the harp, son of Alpin; another song shall rise. My soul shall depart in the sound; my fathers shall hear it in their airy hall. - Their dim faces shall hang, with 
joy, from their clouds; and their hands receive their son.</p><p xml:id="JG24940" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">The aged oak bends over the stream. It sighs with all its moss. The withered fern whistles near, and mixes, as it waves, with Ossian's hair. - Strike the harp and raise the song: be near, with all your wings, ye winds. Bear the mournful sound away to Fingal's 
airy hall. Bear it to Fingal's hall, that he may hear the voice of his son; the voice of him that praised the mighty. - The blast of north opens thy gates, O king, and I behold thee sitting on mist, dimly gleaming in all thine arms. Thy form now is not the terror of the valiant: but like a 
watery cloud; when we see the stars behind it with their weeping eyes. Thy shield is like the aged moon: thy sword a vapour half-kindled with fire. Dim and feeble is the chief, who travelled in brightness before. - </p><p xml:id="JG24941" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But thy steps are on the winds of the desart, and the storms darken in thy hand. Thou takest the sun in thy wrath, and hidest him in thy clouds. The sons of little men are afraid; and a thousand showers descend. - </p><p xml:id="JG24942" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But when thou comest forth in thy mildness; the gale of the morning is near thy course. The sun laughs in his blue fields; and the gray stream winds in its valley. - The bushes shake their green heads in the wind. The roes bound towards the desart.</p><p xml:id="JG24943" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But there is a murmur in the heath! the stormy winds abate! I hear the voice of Fingal. Long has it been absent from my ear! - Come, Ossian, come away, he says: Fingal has received his fame. We passed away, like flames that had shone for a season, our departure 
was in renown. Though the plains of our battles are dark and silent; our same is in the four gray stones. The voice of Ossian has been heard; and the harp was strung in Selma. - Come Ossian, come away, he says, and fly with thy fathers on clouds.</p><p xml:id="JG24944" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">And come I will, thou king of men! the life of Ossian fails. I begin to vanish on Cona; and my steps are not seen in Selma. Beside the stone of Mora I shall fall asleep. The winds whistling in my grey hair, shall not waken me. - Depart on thy wings, O wind: thou 
canst not disturb the rest of the bard. The night is long, but his eyes are heavy; depart, thou rustling blast.</p><p xml:id="JG24945" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">But why art thou sad, son of Fingal? Why grows the cloud of thy soul? The chiefs of other times are departed; they have gone without their fame. The sons of future years shall pass away; and another race arise. The people are like the waves of ocean: like the 
leaves of woody Morven, they pass away in the rustling blast, and other leaves lift their green heads. - </p><p xml:id="JG24946" rend="Prosatext" TEIform="p">Did thy beauty last, O Ryno? Stood the strength of car-borne Oscar? Fingal himself passed away; and the halls of his fathers forgot his steps. - And shalt thou remain, aged bard! when the mighty have failed? - But my fame shall remain, and grow like the oak of 
Morven; which lifts its broad head to the storm, and rejoices in the course of the wind.</p><p xml:id="JG24947" TEIform="p">Finis.</p></div4></div3></page>
